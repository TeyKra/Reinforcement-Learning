# Practice Lab: Actor-Critic with Softmax Policy - Pendulum Swing-Up

## Overview

This lab focuses on developing and implementing a **softmax-based Actor-Critic (AC)** agent for a continuing task. The objective is to gain practical insights into reinforcement learning techniques, particularly in:

1. **Average Reward Framework**:
   - Utilize the average reward framework to evaluate performance in a continuing task.

2. **Policy Representation**:
   - Represent the policy as a **parameterized function** suited for discrete action spaces.

3. **Gradient Approximation**:
   - Explore methods to **approximate and sample the gradient** of the objective for updating the actor.

4. **Critic Update**:
   - Implement the **differential Temporal Difference (TD) error** for updating the critic.

This lab will equip you with a deeper understanding of the Actor-Critic method and its application to control problems like the Pendulum Swing-Up.
