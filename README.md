## Overview

This lab focuses on implementing the **Q-learning** algorithm, a reinforcement learning technique used to train an AI agent through trial and error. The objective is to enable a robot, using the **AlphAI** platform, to navigate an environment while avoiding obstacles.

### Key Concepts:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The agent learns autonomously by exploring different strategies and receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Q-learning Algorithm**: A table-based approach where the agent updates a **Q-table** to estimate the best possible actions for each state.
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: The agent must balance trying new actions (exploration) and leveraging known good actions (exploitation).

### Lab Objectives:
1. **Implement the Q-learning algorithm in Python** and apply it to train a robot to avoid obstacles.
2. **Configure the environment** in the AlphAI platform and initialize the Q-table.
3. **Develop decision-making functions** that allow the agent to act based on Q-values.
4. **Introduce exploration mechanisms** to ensure the agent discovers optimal strategies.
5. **Optimize learning parameters** (learning rate, discount factor) for better performance.
