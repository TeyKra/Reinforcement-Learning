# Lab6 : Swinging Up the Pendulum Using DDPG

## Overview

This lab focuses on implementing the **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** algorithm, a reinforcement learning technique designed for continuous action spaces. The objective is to train an agent to swing up and balance an **inverted pendulum** by leveraging an **actor-critic framework**.
