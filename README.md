## 1: MountainCar-v0 with Function Approximation

In this lab, the **MountainCar-v0** environment is implemented using:
- **Function approximation**: To represent the Q-function in continuous state spaces.
- **Epsilon-greedy exploration**: To balance exploration and exploitation during training.

### Objective:
Train an agent to drive a car up a steep hill by approximating the Q-values and improving its policy iteratively.

## 2: FrozenLake with Q-Learning

In this lab, the **FrozenLake** environment is implemented using:
- **Q-learning algorithm**: To learn an optimal policy for navigating the grid.
- **Epsilon-greedy exploration**: To explore the state-action space effectively.

### Objective:
Train an agent to navigate a grid world, avoid falling into holes, and reach the goal.
