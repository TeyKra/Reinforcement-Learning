# Lab7:Introduction to Stable Baselines - PPO
This lab provides a hands-on introduction to the Stable Baselines3 library through the RL Baselines3 Zoo framework. You'll learn how to create, train, and evaluate a PPO model, and discover how a unified interface simplifies switching between different reinforcement learning algorithms. The lab also covers hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and visualization techniques, offering a practical overview of modern reinforcement learning methods.
