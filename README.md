# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains four branches, each dedicated to a specific reinforcement learning lab

## Branches and Labs

1. **Reinforcement-Learning - TP1:**
    - This project explores value iteration and policy iteration algorithms in a maze environment modeled as an MDP. The goal is to optimize policies by maximizing expected rewards, with a comparative analysis of computational efficiency. Visualizations illustrate convergence rates and performance.
